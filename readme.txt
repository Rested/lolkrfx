This script can be (on a mac, should be easily modifiable to windows by replacing the paths in the script with the windows paths) used to change the language of the old lol client beyond the officially supported languages.

Before using it you must update the client to the newest version and dont click launch on the old client.

Then run the python script as python lolkrfx.py following the instructions you can find from running python lolkrfx.py -h

When new patches are released assuming nothing changes you can simply:
    * look at the project version to find the -p parameter here: /Applications/League of Legends.app/Contents/LoL/RADS/projects/lol_air_client/releases
    * look at the solution version to find the -s parameter here: /Applications/League of Legends.app/Contents/LoL/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases
